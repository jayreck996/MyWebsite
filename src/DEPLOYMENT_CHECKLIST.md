## Troubleshooting Reference

If something doesn't work:

| Issue | Check | Fix Guide |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Build fails | Amplify build logs | Check `amplify.yml` and dependencies |
| Site doesn't load | CloudFront/Amplify status | Check deployment status |
| Form doesn't submit | Browser console | Check API endpoint URL |
| DynamoDB empty | Edge Function logs | `FIX_DYNAMODB_ZERO_ITEMS.md` |
| S3 upload fails | IAM permissions | Check S3 bucket policy |
| CORS errors | Backend CORS config | Update CORS headers |

---

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Weekly
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Monitor AWS costs
- [ ] Test contact form

### Monthly
- [ ] Review DynamoDB items
- [ ] Clean up old S3 files (if needed)
- [ ] Update dependencies (`npm update`)
- [ ] Check for security updates

### Quarterly
- [ ] Review IAM permissions
- [ ] Audit AWS costs
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security review

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment breaks something:

### Option 1: Revert in Amplify
1. Go to Amplify Console
2. Click on the app
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Find last working deployment
5. Click "Redeploy this version"

### Option 2: Git Revert
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
# Amplify will auto-deploy previous version
```

### Option 3: Emergency Fix
```bash
# Fix the issue locally
git add .
git commit -m "Hotfix: [description]"
git push
# Amplify will auto-deploy
```
