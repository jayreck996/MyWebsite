# üî¥ CURRENT ERROR: Missing dynamodb:Scan Permission

## What Just Happened?

You tried to use the **DynamoDB Scanner** component and got this error:

```
AccessDeniedException: User sweetchilli996 is not authorized 
to perform: dynamodb:Scan on resource: table/user
```

## Why Did This Happen?

Your IAM user has permissions to:
- ‚úÖ Write to DynamoDB (`dynamodb:PutItem`)
- ‚úÖ Read items (`dynamodb:GetItem`)
- ‚úÖ Describe the table (`dynamodb:DescribeTable`)
- ‚úÖ Upload to S3 (`s3:PutObject`)

But it's **missing**:
- ‚ùå **Scan the table** (`dynamodb:Scan`)

The Scanner needs to scan the table to count and display all items.

## üöÄ Fix It Right Now (2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Use the Alert Banner

Look at the **top of your website** - there's a yellow alert banner with:
- A button to **Open IAM Console**
- A button to **Copy Full Policy JSON**

Click those buttons and follow the instructions!

### Option 2: Manual Fix

1. **Open IAM Console:**
   ```
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/sweetchilli996?section=permissions
   ```

2. **Edit your policy** (probably named `ContactFormAppPolicy`)

3. **Add this permission** to the DynamoDB actions:
   ```json
   "dynamodb:Scan"
   ```

4. **Full corrected policy:**
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "dynamodb:PutItem",
           "dynamodb:GetItem",
           "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
           "dynamodb:Scan"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:298552056601:table/user"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:GetObject"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Save and wait 30 seconds**

6. **Test:** Click "Scan Table" again

## ‚úÖ After the Fix

Once you add the `dynamodb:Scan` permission, you'll be able to:

- ‚úÖ Use the **DynamoDB Scanner** (bottom-left corner)
- ‚úÖ See the **actual item count** in your table
- ‚úÖ View all submitted contact forms
- ‚úÖ Verify that form submissions are being saved correctly

## ü§î Do I Need This Permission?

**Short answer:** Yes, if you want to use the diagnostic tools.

**Long answer:**
- **dynamodb:Scan** is only needed for the DynamoDB Scanner component
- Your contact form will still work without it
- But you won't be able to see if items are being saved
- It's useful for debugging and verification

If you don't want to add this permission, you can:
1. Check items directly in the AWS Console
2. Remove the DynamoDBScanner component from your app
3. Use the AWS CLI: `aws dynamodb scan --table-name user`

## üéØ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Yellow alert banner appeared on your website
- [ ] You clicked "Open IAM Console"
- [ ] You found the policy attached to `sweetchilli996`
- [ ] You edited the policy
- [ ] You added `"dynamodb:Scan"` to the Actions array
- [ ] You saved the changes
- [ ] You waited 30 seconds
- [ ] You clicked "Scan Table" again
- [ ] It worked! ‚úÖ

## üÜò Still Stuck?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the policy was saved correctly**
   - Go back to IAM Console
   - View the policy JSON
   - Verify `"dynamodb:Scan"` is in the Actions array

2. **Wait longer**
   - Sometimes AWS takes up to 60 seconds to propagate changes
   - Try refreshing your browser

3. **Check for typos**
   - The permission must be exactly: `"dynamodb:Scan"`
   - Not `"dynamoDB:Scan"` or `"dynamodb:scan"`

4. **Verify the resource ARN**
   - Make sure the table name in the ARN is `user`
   - Make sure the region is `us-east-1`

## üéâ Success!

Once this is fixed, everything should work perfectly. The error will disappear, and you'll be able to use all the diagnostic tools to verify your form submissions are being saved correctly.

Good luck! üöÄ
